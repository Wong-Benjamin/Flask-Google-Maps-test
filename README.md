Project to begin familiarizing one's self with Python flask for web applications, as well as refreshing web dev memory in regards to js, html, and css.

Originally created and developed on Google cloud run services / cloud shell editor services. 

If still running, the last deployment of this code should be found at the URL https://first-project-xvxazr4jvq-pd.a.run.app/.

Most of contents here are irrelevant and holdovers from Google Cloud's tutorial template -- the only relevant (and ones edited / written by me) are templates --> map.html, and app.py.
